# PT Insight: Commons

This folder contains common libraries for Java and Python to work with PT Insight.
This includes the protocol buffer definitions for Kafka messages.

## Work with protobuf
After changing any protobuf definitions, run `make proto` to generate the language-specific implementations and some auxiliary files.

Install the protobuf compiler `protoc` first as shown in the top-level readme.
